# Desktop UA on YouTube Music for Firefox Android

This addon for Firefox for Android sends a Firefox Desktop user agent when visiting YouTube Music.
It allows you to stream music using the responsive UI on mobile, without making everything super-small with the desktop mode.
It seems that Firefox can handle the "full" version of the site well enough that the extra functionality is beneficial.

This is the User Agent used:
`Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:62.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/62.0`


## Installation

This add-on is available at Firefox Add-ons:

## Credits

which in turn is based on this user-agent rewriter:

It's based on the new WebExtensions standard.
